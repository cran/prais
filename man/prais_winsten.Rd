\title{Prais-Winsten Estimator for AR(1) Serial Correlation}
\usage{
prais_winsten(formula, data, max_iter = 50L, tol = 1e-06,
  twostep = FALSE, index = NULL, ...)

\method{print}{prais}(x, digits = max(3L, getOption("digits") - 3L), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{an object of class \code{"formula"} (or one that can be coerced to that class):
a symbolic description of the model to be fitted.}

\item{data}{a data frame containing the variables in the model. If panel data is used,
it must also contain the ID and time variables.}

\item{max_iter}{integer specifying the maximum number of allowed iterations. Default is 50.}

\item{tol}{numeric specifying the maximum absolute difference between the estimator of \eqn{rho}
in the current and the previous iteration that has to be attained to reach convergence.
Default is 1e-6.}

\item{twostep}{logical. If \code{TRUE}, the estimation will stop after the first iteration.}

\item{index}{a character vector specifying the ID and time variables. If only one variable
is provided, it is assumed to be the time variable and the data will be reordered
accordingly. If \code{NULL} (default), the function assumes that the provided sample is
an ordered time series with the earliest observations in the first row.}

\item{...}{arguments passed to \code{\link[stats]{lm}}.}

\item{x}{an object of class "prais", usually, a result of a call to \code{\link{prais_winsten}}.}

\item{digits}{the number of significant digits to use when printing.}
}
\value{
A list of class \code{"prais"} containing the following components:
\item{coefficients}{a named vector of coefficients.}
\item{rho}{the values of the AR(1) coefficient \eqn{\rho} from all iterations.}
\item{residuals}{the residuals, that is the response minus the fitted values.}
\item{fitted.values}{the fitted mean values.}
\item{rank}{the numeric rank of the fitted linear model.}
\item{df.residual}{the residual degrees of freedom.}
\item{call}{the matched call.}
\item{terms}{the terms object used.}
\item{model}{the original model frame, i.e., before the Prais-Winsten transformation.}
\item{index}{a character specifying the ID and time variables.}
}
\description{
The Prais-Winsten estimator takes into account AR(1) serial correlation of the errors
in a linear regression model. The procedure recursively estimates the coefficients
and the error autocorrelation of the specified model until sufficient convergence of
the AR(1) coefficient is reached. All estimates are obtained by OLS.
}
\details{
If \eqn{\rho} takes a value above 1 during the estimation process,
the Prais-Winsten transformation cannot be applied to the first
observations, because \eqn{(1 - \rho^2)^{(1 / 2)}} is not real. These observations
are dropped during the respective iteration and the estimator effectively becomes
the Cochrane-Orcutt estimator.

\examples{
# Generate an artificial sample
set.seed(1234567)
n <- 100
x <- sample(20:40, n, replace = TRUE)
rho <- .5

# AR(1) errors
u <- rnorm(n, 0, 5)
for (i in 2:n) {
  u[i] <- u[i] + rho * u[i - 1]
}
pw_sample <- data.frame("x" = x, "y" = 10 + 1.5 * x + u)

# Estimate
pw <- prais_winsten(y ~ x, data = pw_sample)
summary(pw)
